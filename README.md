# Expert Helper
An Expert helper utility for Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes: Rule version 241.

### Background
For fun, I decided to write a web-based app to not only keep track of various elements for each bomb (battery, serial, etc.), but to help solve most of the puzzles as well by various shortcuts.

### Demo
You can directly use this tool from this github page:

Enjoy!
